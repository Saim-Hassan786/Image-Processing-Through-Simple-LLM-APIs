# Image Processing with Gemini (Google GenAI)

This guide explains the **basic concepts** behind using Google’s Gemini model for image processing, through the `googlegenai` package. It focuses on **how it works**, not how to code it.

## What is Gemini?

Gemini is a **multimodal AI model** by Google that can understand both **text and images** together. It is part of Google's advanced AI systems designed for tasks like:

- Describing images
- Answering questions about pictures
- Extracting information from visuals
- Understanding diagrams or documents

---

## What is Multimodal AI?

**Multimodal AI** means a model that can work with **multiple types of input**—for example:

- Text
- Images
- Audio (in some models)

Gemini processes text and images at the same time to give **better answers**.

---

## How Does Gemini Process Images?

1. **Image is divided into small parts** (called "patches") and turned into numbers.
2. **Text is turned into tokens** (just like words are split into parts in chatbots).
3. Gemini **analyzes both the image and text together**, learning patterns and relationships.
4. The model gives a response based on what it "sees" and "reads".

## Why Use LLMs for Image Tasks?

Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini are trained on a mix of **text and image data**, so they can:

- Understand **context** better than vision-only models
- Provide **text-based answers** based on what's in the image
- Combine **reasoning** and **visual understanding**

---

## Common Use Cases

- **Image captioning**: “What’s in this picture?”
- **Visual Q&A**: “How many apples are in the photo?”
- **Form understanding**: Reading documents or receipts
- **Alt text generation**: Describing images for accessibility

---

## Benefits of Using Gemini with googlegenai

- Easy to send images along with text
- Works well for **natural language questions about visuals**
- No need to train your own model

---

## Limitations

- Cannot always detect small details
- Works best with clear and relevant images
- Sensitive to **image quality** and **prompt phrasing**

---

## Summary

Gemini, through the `googlegenai` package, helps you process and understand images using the power of language. It brings together the best of **text AI** and **image AI** to make applications more intelligent and interactive.
